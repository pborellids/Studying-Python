# Studying-Python
I'm transitioning into Data Science, and studying a lot of Python and some of its libraries.
For now, only small scripts here. I mean, programs as well, but small. Reason is that I'll only bring my own relevant discoveries provided I consider them important enough for me or for other people that are also studying Python.
Additionally, some scripts may seem way too simplistic for more experienced programmers. But here it's the space where I meet my own learning.
Feel free to use anything you want frmo this repository, but I can't guarantee anything works fine for you. So be careful.
