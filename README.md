# Studying-Python
## My place for self-learning. Hope it serves you as well!
I'm transitioning into Data Science, and studying a lot of Python and some of its libraries.

**For now:**
- only small scripts here.
  - I mean, programs as well, but small. Reason is that I'll only bring my own relevant discoveries provided I consider them important enough for me or for other people that are also studying Python.
  - I'm also learning GitHub while I post here.
- Additionally, some scripts may seem way too simplistic for more experienced programmers. But here it's the space where I meet my own learning.
